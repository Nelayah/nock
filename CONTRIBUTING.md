### Commit Message conventions

`nock` releases are automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
To automatically calculate the correct version number as well as changelogs,
three commit message conventions need to be followed

- Commit bug fixes with `fix: ...` or `fix(scope): ...` prefix in commit subject
- Commit new features with `feat: ...` or `feat(scope): ...` prefix in commit subject
- Commit breaking changes by adding `BREAKING CHANGE: ` in the commit body
  (not the subject line)

Other helpful conventions are

- Commit test files with `test: ...` or `test(scope): ...` prefix
- Commit changes to `package.json`, `.gitignore` and other meta files with
  `chore(filename-without-ext): ...`
- Commit changes to README files or comments with `docs: ...`
- Code style changes with `style: standard`

The commit message(s) of a pull request can be fixed using the `squash & merge` button.

### Generate README TOC

Make sure to update the README's table of contents whenever you update the README using the following npm script.

```
$ npm run toc
```

### Running tests

```
$ npm test
```

#### Airplane mode

Some of the tests depend on online connectivity. To skip them, set the `AIRPLANE` environment variable to some value.

```
$ export AIRPLANE=true
$ npm test
```

### Generating the CONTRIBUTORS.md file

We use [`name-your-contributors`](https://github.com/mntnr/name-your-contributors) to generate the CONTRIBUTORS file, which contains the names of everyone who have submitted code to the Nock codebase, or commented on an issue, or opened a pull request, or reviewed anyone else's code. After all, all contributions are welcome, and anyone who works with Nock is part of our comunity.

To generate this file, download `name-your-contributors` and set up a GitHub authorization token.

```sh
# Generate a JSON file of the members. This may take a while.
$ name-your-contributors -r nock -u nock > contributors.json -a 2018-07-17
```

To parse that file, we suggest using [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), although other options are clearly possible:

```sh
cat contribs.json | jq '.[][]' | jq '"\(if (.name | length) > 0 then .name else null end) @\(.login) \(.url)"' | jq '. | tostring' | jq -s . | jq unique | jq .[] > AUTHORS.md
```

Note: This is a convoluted and time-intensive process, and could be updated in several ways. For one, `name-your-contributors` accepts a date flag, which could be used to only catch recent entries. Another way would be to use a bot to automate this at some regular interval. Any help on this would be appreciated.
